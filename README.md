# Dada - SRHR Virtual Assistant Technical Overview

Dada is a virtual assistant designed to provide comprehensive Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) support using advanced language models and document retrieval techniques.

## Architecture Overview

Dada's architecture consists of several components:

1. **Streamlit Interface**: Dada utilizes Streamlit for building a user-friendly interface to interact with the virtual assistant.

2. **Question-Answering Chain**: The core functionality of Dada lies in the question-answering chain. This chain is configured to integrate language models, document loaders, text splitters, embeddings, retrievers, and memory systems.

3. **Language Models (LM)**: Dada employs OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model for generating responses to user queries. The LM is set up to operate in a conversational mode, providing human-like responses.

4. **Document Retrieval**: Dada retrieves relevant information from documents using document loaders, text splitters, and retrievers. This allows Dada to provide detailed responses based on the content of the provided documents.

5. **Memory System**: Dada maintains a conversation history using a memory system. This enables contextual understanding and continuity in conversations.

## Key Components

- **Configure QA Chain**: The `configure_qa_chain()` function initializes the question-answering chain by setting up document loading, text splitting, embeddings creation, retriever definition, and memory system configuration.

- **StreamHandler**: This class handles the streaming of generated text from the language model to the Streamlit interface, ensuring a smooth display of responses.

- **PrintRetrievalHandler**: This class handles the retrieval of relevant documents and displays them in the Streamlit interface for transparency and context.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and configure the OpenAI API key.

2. **Run Application**: Start the Streamlit application using the provided command.

3. **Interact with Dada**: Use the Streamlit interface to ask questions related to SRHR. Dada will respond with detailed and contextual information.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Document Retrieval**: Implement more advanced document retrieval techniques to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses.


- **Personalization**: Introduce personalized recommendations and responses based on user profiles and preferences.
